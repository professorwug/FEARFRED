    "We want a distance between graphs with the same number of nodes, obeying:\n",
    "1. The cost of moving an edge from one neighbor to another neighbor is lower than the cost of moving it from a neighbor to a non-neighbor.\n",
    "2. The distance between a pair of edges having one point in common is smaller than the distance between a pair of edges having no points in common.\n",
    "3. The above differences in magnitude correspond to the geodesic (manifold) distances on the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a distance could be useful to FRED. We've previously used the KLD between adjacency matrices as a proxy for this graph-to-graph distance, but the KLD doesn't respect the graph geometry â€” all edges are equally far apart. As a result, gradients flowing from the KLD can't give as useful information to the model -- insofar as *which* way to tweak the edges or move the nodes -- as might the mythical EEEMD."
